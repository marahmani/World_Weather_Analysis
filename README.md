# World_Weather_Analysis

We are helping Jack for suggestion to his client’s ideal Hotels. We are going to find out hotels given the latitude and longitude, as well as the right kind of weather foe client.

Basic Project Plan

Our basic project plan is to collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide. We will use PlanMyTrip data to recommend ideal hotels based on client’s weather preferences. 
We are using 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

While collecting the data we consider all possible outcome weather such as 
•	The latitude and longitude
•	The Max temperature
•	The % humidity
•	The % cloudiness
•	The Wind speeds
•	The Weather description, i.e., cloudy, fog, light rain, clear sky, etc.
Then we create Customer Travel Destinations Map so they would be able to search vacation based on their needs.

Then we set-up the pop-up markers on the map that has the hotel name and location as a pop up so it woud be easier for clients to search

we chose four cities that a customer might want to visit. They are close together and in the same country, Half Moon Bay, Discovery Bay, San Joaquin and San Ramon. The starting and ending city are the same city and travel_mode is either "DRIVING", "BICYCLING", or "WALKING". we chose driving:

we also added the pop up point to display the hotel in those 4 cities.
